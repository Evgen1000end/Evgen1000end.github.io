"Thick as a Brick" is unquestionably the most progressive, and indeed the best release by Jethro Tull.

The album is one complete piece from start to end, with repeating lyrics and melodies throughout. The lyrics are amusing and witty, including references to Superman, Batman and Robin (Robin DAY was a BBC journalist by the way), and the boy scout manual(!).

The music is a strange mixture of acoustic folk and full blown prog. The album opens with what sounds like an amusing little folk ditty with Anderson singling over acoustic guitar. Sharp bursts of bass, drums and guitar intrude, apparently unnoticed by Anderson until the full band surges in and we're off on 40 minutes of pure fantasy. Anderson's flute never sounded better, but the whole band are working as a unit on this album, giving a depth of quality missing from most of their subsequent albums. Old military sounding themes make way for driving rock bursts, brief orchestration towards the end blends seamlessly with the frantic build up which preceded it. There is true musical magic at work here.

While there is only one track as such, the section towards the start of side 2, with the chorus "Do you believe in the day". Is surprisingly sensitive and beautiful.

The original LP sleeve was a multi-page parody of a local English village newspaper, and was worth the price of the album on its own. It was a worthwhile investment too, good condition copies now selling at grossly inflated prices.

The essential Tull album.
